# User-facing documentation
The user-facing documentation is available on a dedicated repository inside the organization: [https://github.com/TriliumNext/Docs](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Docs) 

It is currently organized as a flat tree of MarkDown notes.

The documentation started as an import of the existing upstream documentation in [https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki).

The public documentation is available at [https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki).

The repository is here: [https://github.com/TriliumNext/Docs](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Docs) 

The documentation is stored as Markdown files and is meant to be imported into Trilium Notes and then exported back in, as per the README. However, it's also possible to modify the Markdown files manually and push the changes.

The documentation is deployed automatically to GitHub Pages on every push on the `main` branch.
