# Quick search
![](Quick%20search_image.png)

The _Quick search_ function does a full-text search (that is, it searches through the content of notes and not just the title of a note) and displays the result in an easy-to-access manner.

The alternative to the quick search is the [Search](Search.md) function, which opens in a dedicated tab and has support for advanced queries.

For even faster navigation, it's possible to use [Jump to Note](Jump%20to%20Note.md) which will only search through the note titles instead of the content.

## Layout

Based on the [Vertical and horizontal layout](../UI%20Elements/Vertical%20and%20horizontal%20layout.md), the quick search is placed:

*   On the vertical layout, it is displayed right above the [Note Tree](../UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md).
*   On the horizontal layout, it is displayed in the [Launch Bar](../UI%20Elements/Launch%20Bar.md), where it can be positioned just like any other icon.
