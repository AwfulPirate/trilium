# Floating buttons
![](Floating%20buttons_image.png)

Depending on the current note, a panel will appear near the top-right of the note, right underneath the <a class="reference-link" href="Ribbon.md">Ribbon</a>. These buttons offer additional interaction that is specific to that particular note.

For example:

*   For <a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/Mermaid%20Diagrams.md">Mermaid Diagrams</a> and <a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/Canvas.md">Canvas</a>, there are buttons to download the SVG representation of the note, or to copy a reference to the note for pasting it a <a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/Text.md">Text</a> note.
*   For [read-only notes](../Notes/Read-Only%20Notes.md), there is a button to temporarily edit the note for quick modifications.

## Interaction

The floating button area can be collapsed by pressing the two right arrows at the end of the section.
