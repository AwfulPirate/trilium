# Links
## External links

An external link is a standard web link targeting for example a website. For example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South\_China\_Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea) is an external link to a Wikipedia page.

To create a link without a custom text:

*   Press <img src="1_Links_image.png" width="15" height="16"> in theÂ <a class="reference-link" href="Formatting%20toolbar.md">Formatting toolbar</a>:
    *   A popup will appear, type or paste the URL in the box.
    *   Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the check mark icon to confirm.
*   Alternatively, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> to trigger the aforementioned popup.
*   A simpler way is to paste the raw link and press space to turn it automatically into a link.

To create a link with a custom text:

*   First, type and select the text which will be turned into a link.
*   Follow the previous steps to open the link interface (via the formatting toolbar, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>).
*   Alternatively, simply paste (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>) over the selected text to turn it into a link.

Once a link is inserted:

*   The text inside the link can be changed if needed but the link itself will remain.
*   To modify the link, click on the link to display the popup and press the <img src="Links_image.png" width="18" height="18"> _Edit link_ button.
*   To remove a link, click on it and press the <img src="2_Links_image.png" width="18" height="18"> _Unlink_ button.

You can follow external link by either double clicking (will open new tab/window) it or right clicking on them and choosing "Open in new tab".

## Internal links to notes

Links to internal notes are created a bit differently. To create link to note at current cursor position, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>.

In the dialog you can see radio button to choose from different types of linking:

*   link title mirrors the note's current title - this is sometimes also called "reference link". Title of such links cannot be changed, instead it is always mirroring the title of linked note. This way the link title is never outdated
*   link title can be changed arbitrarily - this is the traditional hyperlink - you link to a particular note and can choose the link title

You can follow the note link by double clicking it.

Alternatively if you only wish to quickly preview the content, you can hover over the link and will see read only preview.

### In-place linking

Trilium also provides "inline" linking - type `@` and you'll see an autocomplete, just type few characters from the desired note title, press enter and you have a link.

## Note map

Trilium provides a visualisation of incoming and outgoing links for a particular note. See [note map](../../Advanced%20Usage/Note%20Map%20\(Link%20map%2C%20Tree%20map\).md) for details.
