# Content language
A language hint can be provided for text notes. This option informs the browser or the desktop application about the language the note is written in (for example this might help with spellchecking), and it also determines whether the text is displayed from right-to-left for languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, etc.

For more information about right-to-left support, see [Right-to-left text notes](../../Basic%20Concepts/Note/Right-to-Left%20Support.md).

To set the language of the content, go to “Basic Properties” and look for the “Language” field. By default there will be no content languages set, they can be configured by going to settings or by selecting the “Configure languages” item in the list.
