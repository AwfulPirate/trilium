# Include Note
Text notes can "include" another note as a read-only widget. This can be useful for e.g. including a dynamically generated chart (from scripts & "render HTML" note) or other more advanced use cases.

## Including a note

In theÂ <a class="reference-link" href="Formatting%20toolbar.md">Formatting toolbar</a>, look for the <img src="Include Note_image.png" width="16" height="16"> button. There is also a keyboard shortcut defined for it but it is not allocated by default.
