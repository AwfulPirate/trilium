# Attributes
In Trilium, attributes are key-value pairs assigned to notes, providing additional metadata or functionality. There are two primary types of attributes:

1.  <a class="reference-link" href="Attributes/Labels.md">Labels</a>: Simple key-value text records
2.  <a class="reference-link" href="Attributes/Relations.md">Relations</a>: Named links to other notes

These attributes play a crucial role in organizing, categorising, and enhancing the functionality of notes.

## Labels

Labels in Trilium can be used for a variety of purposes, such as storing metadata or configuring the behaviour of notes. Labels are also searchable, enhancing note retrieval.

For more information, including predefined labels, see <a class="reference-link" href="Attributes/Labels.md">Labels</a>.

## Relations

Relations define connections between notes, similar to links. These can be used for metadata and scripting purposes.

For more information, including a list of predefined relations, see <a class="reference-link" href="Attributes/Relations.md">Relations</a>.

## Multiplicity

Attributes in Trilium can be "multi-valued", meaning multiple attributes with the same name can co-exist.

## Attribute Definitions and Promoted Attributes

Special labels create "label/attribute" definitions, enhancing the organization and management of attributes. For more details, see <a class="reference-link" href="Attributes/Promoted%20Attributes.md">Promoted Attributes</a>.

## Attribute Inheritance

Trilium supports attribute inheritance, allowing child notes to inherit attributes from their parents. For more information, see <a class="reference-link" href="Attributes/Attribute%20Inheritance.md">Attribute Inheritance</a>.
