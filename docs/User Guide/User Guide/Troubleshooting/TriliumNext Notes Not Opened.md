# "TriliumNext Notes" Not Opened
![](2_TriliumNext%20Notes%20Not%20Open.png)

When running TriliumNext for the first time or updating to a newer version, macOS will prevent its execution.

On older versions of macOS it was possible to bypass this step simply by right clicking and selecting Open, which would show a button to run anyway. This got removed since macOS 15.0.

To bypass this issue, follow these steps:

1.  Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security and look for the “Security” section.
2.  There should be a “TriliumNext Notes was blocked to protect your Mac” item. Simply click “Open Anyway”.
3.  Select “Open Anyway” and proceed with the authentication. Afterwards the application should start on its own.
