        <p>A <a href="../Notes.html">note</a> in Trilium can <em>own</em> one or more
          attachments, which can be either images or files. These attachments can
          be displayed or linked within the note that owns them.</p>
        <p>This can be especially useful to include dependencies for your <a href="../../Note%20Types/Code/Scripting.html">scripts</a>.
          The&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Advanced%20Showcases/Weight%20Tracker.html">Weight Tracker</a>&nbsp;shows
          how to use <a href="https://chartjs.org/">chartjs</a> which is attached to
          the script note.</p>
        <p>Each note exclusively owns its attachments, meaning attachments cannot
          be shared or linked from one note to another. If an attachment link is
          copied to a different note, the attachment itself is duplicated, and the
          copies are managed independently thereafter.</p>
        <p>Attachments, especially image files, are the recommended method for embedding
          visuals in notes. It is important to link image attachments within the
          text of the owning note; otherwise, they will be automatically deleted
          after a configurable timeout period if not referenced.</p>
        <h2>Attachment previews</h2>
        <p>Attachments share the same content preview for images, videos, PDFs, etc.
          as the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/File.html">File</a>&nbsp;note
