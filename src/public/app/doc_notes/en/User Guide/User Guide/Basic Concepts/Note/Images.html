      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Trilium supports storing and displaying images. Supported formats are
          JPEG, PNG and GIF.</p>
        <p>An image can be uploaded in the form of note's <a href="Attachments.html">attachment</a> or
          as a standalone <a href="../Navigation/Tree%20Concepts.html">note</a> placed
          into the <a href="../Navigation/Tree%20Concepts.html">note tree</a>. Its
          reference can be copied into a text note, in order to display it in the
          text itself.</p>
        <h2>Uploading images</h2>
        <p>To add an image to the note, simply drag it from file explorer onto the
          note editor inside Trilium and the image will be uploaded.</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img style="aspect-ratio:1003/683;" src="1_Images_image.png" width="1003"
          height="683">
        </figure>
        <p>Alternatively you can click on block toolbar and then on "Insert image":</p>
        <figure
        class="image">
          <img style="aspect-ratio:443/144;" src="Images_image.png" width="443"
          height="144">
          </figure>
          <p>You can also copy and paste an image from web - the image will be (asynchronously)
            downloaded and embedded.</p>
          <h2>Compression</h2>
          <p>Since Trilium isn't really meant to be primary storage for image data,
            it attempts to compress and resize (with pretty aggressive settings) uploaded
            images before storing them to the database. You may then notice some quality
            degradation. Basic quality settings is available in Options -&gt; Other.</p>
          <p>If you want to save images in their original resolution, it is recommended
            to save them as attachment to note (top-right "Note actions -&gt; Import
            files").</p>
