# Tree Manipulation
This page explains how to manipulate the note tree in TriliumNext, focusing on moving notes.

## Drag and Drop

![Drag and drop example](../../Attachments/drag-and-drop.gif)You can easily rearrange the note tree by dragging and dropping notes, as demonstrated in the example above.

## Keyboard Manipulation

![Example of using keyboard keys to move a note](../../Attachments/move-note-with-keyboard.gif)Trilium offers efficient keyboard-based manipulation using the following [shortcuts](../Keyboard%20Shortcuts.md):

*   `CTRL-UP` and `CTRL-DOWN`: Move the note up or down in the order.
*   `CTRL-LEFT`: Move the note up in the hierarchy by changing its parent to the note's grandparent.
*   `CTRL-RIGHT`: Move the note down in the hierarchy by setting its parent to the note currently above it (this action is best understood through a demo or hands-on experience).
*   `LEFT` and `RIGHT`: Expand and collapse a sub-tree.

## Context Menu

You can also move notes using the familiar cut and paste functions available in the context menu, or with the associated keyboard [shortcuts](../Keyboard%20Shortcuts.md): `CTRL-C` ( [copy](../Note/Cloning%20Notes.md)), `CTRL-X` (cut) and `CTRL-V` (paste).
